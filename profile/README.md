## 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

  

Github and friends is an open community that seeks to foster and cultivate student talent by teaching and collaborating on projects in teams using Github. Over the last couple of years, github has become the house for most software and open source repositories. Github and friends seeks to provide that platform to allow its members to work together and learn new skills as well as share ideas in tech and possibly contribute to the open source community.
