## Hi there 👋,  We are friends on github

# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction 

Github and friends is an open community that seeks to foster and cultivate student talent by teaching and collaborating on projects in teams using Github.

# 🌈 Contribution guidelines 

More to come but basically before you critique, suggest 

# 👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

# 🍿 Fun facts

- We eat issues for breakfast, commits for lunch and pull requests for supper
- All members of this group one way or another have a certification on Sololearn
